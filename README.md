2. XGBoostRegressor is an implementation of the XGBoost algorithm specifically designed for regression tasks in machine learning.

It's an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and generalization. XGBoost is known for its efficiency, speed, and performance, making it a popular choice for regression problems. It utilizes gradient boosting, where weak learners (decision trees) are built sequentially, each correcting the errors of the previous one. Parameters like learning rate, number of trees, and tree-specific settings can be tuned to optimize performance for a given regression problem.
